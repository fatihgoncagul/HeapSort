# HeapSort
Here is an assignment I had at Algorithms class.The subject is Heap Sort for k sorted arrays.
## The Assignment:
We are given an unsorted array A[1â€¦n]. Now, imagine its sorted 
version. The unsorted array has the property that each element has a 
distance of at most k positions, where 0<k<=n, from its index in the 
sorted version. For example, when k is 2, an element at index 5 in the 
sorted array, can be at one of the indices {3,4,5,6,7} in the unsorted 
array. The unsorted array can be sorted efficiently by utilizing a MinHeap data structure. The outline of the algorithm is given below 
- Create a Min Heap of size k+1 with first k+1 elements, 
- One by one remove min element from the heap, put it in the 
result array, and add a new element to the heap from remaining 
elements. 

**a**. Write down the complete algorithm in pseudocode convention 
to sort the array A. 

**b**. Provide a tight asymptotic upper bound time complexity for this 
algorithm. Show your work. 

**c**. Implement your solution in any language you prefer. Generate 
the array sizes of 100,1000,10000,100000 with using your 
student id as a seed. Run your solution and note the running 
times. Show your results.
